          <h1>The 2018 Lead Awards</h1>
          <p>LEAD, or Leadership Empowerment And Development, an initiative founded by Unifed, fosters an open workplace community open to both men and women, specifically designed to educate and encourage female employees to pursue their highest career ambitions with confidence. For the second year in a row, The LEAD Awards, is celebrating the men and women who actively strive toward gender equality. My role was to create the entire identity for the event.</p>
